NO ENTIENDO MUY BIEN ESTA PARTE:

– Line art should have a minimum resolution of 600
dpi;
– grayscales (incl photos) should have a minimum
resolution of 300 dpi (no lettering), or 500 dpi
(when there is lettering);
– do not save figures as JPEG, this format may lose
information in the process;
– do not use figures taken from the Internet, the res-
olution will be too low for printing;
– do not use color in your figures if they are to be
printed in black & white, as this will reduce the
print quality (note that in software the default is
often color, so you should change the settings);
– for figures that should be printed in color, please
send a CMYK encoded EPS.
